CSHIFT facilities\r\nare provided, similar to HPF and cmfortran, and user control is given over the mapping of\r\narray indices to both MPI tasks and SIMD processing elements.\r\n\r\n* Identically shaped arrays then be processed with perfect data parallelisation.\r\n* Such identically shapped arrays are called conformable arrays.\r\n\r\nThe transformation is based on the observation that Cartesian array processing involves\r\nidentical processing to be performed on different regions of the Cartesian array.\r\n\r\nThe library will both geometrically decompose into MPI tasks and across SIMD lanes.\r\nLocal vector loops are parallelised with OpenMP pragmas.\r\n\r\nData parallel array operations can then be specified with a SINGLE data parallel paradigm, but\r\noptimally use MPI, OpenMP and SIMD parallelism under the hood. This is a significant simplification\r\nfor most programmers.\r\n\r\nThe layout transformations are parametrised by the SIMD vector length. This adapts according to the architecture.\r\nPresently SSE2 (128 bit) AVX, AVX2 (256 bit) and IMCI and AVX512 (512 bit) targets are supported.\r\n\r\nThese are presented as\r\n\r\n  vRealF, vRealD, vComplexF, vComplexD\r\n\r\ninternal vector data types. These may be useful in themselves for other programmers.\r\nThe corresponding scalar types are named\r\n\r\n  RealF, RealD, ComplexF, ComplexD\r\n\r\nMPI, OpenMP, and SIMD parallelism are present in the library.\r\n\r\n   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters\r\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here\r\nis are examples:\r\n\r\n     ./configure CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=\"-std=c++11 -O3 -mavx\" --enable-simd=AVX1\r\n\r\n     ./configure CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=\"-std=c++11 -O3 -mavx2\" --enable-simd=AVX2\r\n\r\n     ./configure CXX=icpc CXXFLAGS=\"-std=c++11 -O3 -mmic\" --enable-simd=AVX512 --host=none\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
